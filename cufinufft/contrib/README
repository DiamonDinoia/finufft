- utils.h

  Definition of BIGINT is replaced with CUFINUFFT_BIGINT and is changed to the normal 4 byte integer

- utils.cpp
  This is required because of the use of computing norm, relative norm of vectors, e.g. relerrtwonorm, in the test codes.

- common.h 
- common.cpp (hence legendre_rule_fast.c/.h are included)
