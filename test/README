Testing (validation not performance) directory for FINUFFT.

All source codes in here are dual precision (ie, depending on the -DSINGLE
compilation flag presence, they build double or single precision and link
against the appropriate FINUFFT library functions).

basicpassfail{f} : basic double and single-prec smoke tests
                   (exit code 0 is a pass).
check_finufft.sh : validates the FINUFFT library for correctness
                   (exit code 0 is a pass). See docs in that script.
results/*.out : outputs written by check_finufft.sh for the record.
results/*.refout : reference outputs that the generated outputs *,out will be compared against.

Possibly obsolete scripts (for developers):
checkallaccs.sh : spreading and NUFFT at all #s of digits, for a single ndims

Also see:
../perftest for performance tests
