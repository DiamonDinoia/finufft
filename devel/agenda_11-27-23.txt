Goals: make release with some ok and stable stuff in it


Release (name = v2.3 or v2.2.1?)  ------------------------------------------

 - presumably a tag on GH, once done

 - 2.2 = 2.2.0dev0 never tagged. Last release was 2.1 in June 2022.

 - binaries available for users (requests eg #362) -> place binaries for
   3 OSes somewhere on GH. Can automate?  Kill off my old binary webpage.


CI ...........

CI/jenkins/ branch -> failing suddenly 11/22 - why?

CI status runs only CPU tests:
    spreadtestall.sh  (has no math checking, a small perf test)
    basicpassfail{f} (exit code checks math)
    check_finufft.sh (both prec; has math chk + dumbinputs chk)
    CI doesn't run GPU!

CI improvements:
    run examples?
    fortran / other langs ? (complicated in CI...)

PR 254 - CI using cmake(ctest), builds on.
  - can OMP_NUM_THREADS be set in platform-indep way in ctest add_test() ? no
    DD says do in C++: https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft/pull/254
    Much easier, but needs a new cmd arg in the test/*.cpp executables

CI py had zero CPU time on windows -> div-by-0 error! (I fixed). why?


library.....

[ahb brought in PR 354 thread safety. Simplifies docs too.
 - jax waiting on this
 - ask Robert: unclear why some fftw_free or alloc are mutexed and not others?
 - ahb tested w/ all make tasks.]
 
GPU: PR 330: deal w/ cuda streams     - difficult for ahb to test
 - jax waiting on this
 - multicoil MRI users have opinions

remove obsolete bkw-compat (nufft_opts) ?


wrappers....

Libin to fix (1,M) vs (M,) Py issue #367 

[Libin did PR for #359, but not closed? I tested py and closed]

pr 308 - no


docs....

RTD missing a Secret for webhook to tell GH; RTD won't give it :)
I changed repo to FI/finufft from ahbarnett/finufft  ... RTD webhook fails
(code 400). Resync fails.  Checked build (py 3.11) by hand is ok (1 min).
ask Dylan.


Notes for team......

  We need to keep docs/* and CHANGELOG up to date when make changes!

  who tests GPU code and adds more tests, CI?

  Please close an issue after you fix it



========= FUTURE DECISIONS =============

* Build:
  - keep makefile, yes, but slowly deprecate (eg Leslie/Alex rely on it) ?

* CI:
   complete rest of PR 254 for CI via cmake/ctest.

* CPU: allow FFT switching (plus in cmake but not old makefile?)
  - see Reinecke pr 287

* GPU: paquiteau request for multi-coil MRI:
having multiples plans with shared memory (e.g. for the NUpts locations and others parameters) could be an alternative ?
https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft/pull/330
  - GPU interface to py

* explicit 1D slices for fftw, cuts 2d and 3d fft cost down (Reinecke idea)
   - issues: work with batching too (batched 1d's?). nontrivial, benchmark.
   - a couple of days work

* improved window shapes, more upsampfacs, like ducc0
  - several days work

* SIMD spread/interp/sort
  - significant work

* source code formatting?

* Marco plan April through Aug 2024



Random Questions

#569 ? onedim_fseries_kernel  ... was not brought in

Can I kill .travis.yml ? (3 yrs old - what's it for?)
